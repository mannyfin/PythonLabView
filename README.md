# PythonLabView
In-house code to perform Temperature Programmed Desorption. Synchronizes a Eurotherm Temperature Controller, and a Mass Spectrometer

The "Meat" of the code is in the TPD_Program and TPD folders. 

Much of the other files were tests/fun things and can be ignored.

This code was written together with A. Gilman.
